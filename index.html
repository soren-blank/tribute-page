            <blockquote>
                <p>A visionary, an innovator and a great police leader, Jack Maple changed the face of policing in New York and America. In a time when the conventional wisdom proclaimed that police could not affect crime, Jack Maple knew better and proved it wrong. He conceived and implemented the CompStat system in 1994; since then the NYPD has driven down crime to historically low levels. His vision of a safe city is our reality today.</p>
